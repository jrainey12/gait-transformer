# gait-transformer

Gait classifier based on Vision Transformer.


Currently performing gender classification using a basic ViT model with various representations.

The goal is to make a full classifier for gait recognition based on the ViT architecture.


## Progress

Basic ViT model implemented.
Adapting the basic ViT model to use siamese architecture to better suit gait recognition. 
Looking at other ViT based methods to see which improvments/varitions could work for gait.
